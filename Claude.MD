# Design System
Use Bootstrap components whenever possible.
Check whether other implementations have been made for controls and reuse CSS classes as much as possible.

# PHP Codebase
PHP codebase is in src
New Angular/frontend codebase is in src_new/label-dashboard-web
New NodeJS/backend codebase is in src_new/label-dashboard-api
Refer to PHP codebase for logical implementation but never change anything in this folder.

# Backend implementation
First check available backend APIs. If modification is needed, change it. Last resort is to create new APIs.
Backend APIs are in label-dashboard-api.
